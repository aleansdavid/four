My name is David. I was born in Bogot√°. I like pizza :)
I'm adding another two sentences because that's the instructions I got.
Also, I find GIT quite interesting. I hope I'll be familiar with it very soon.

Greetings! Fantastic four group! I hope you're having fun learning about Git and GitHub. Personally, I have understood very little, but hopefully that will change in the next few weeks :)
